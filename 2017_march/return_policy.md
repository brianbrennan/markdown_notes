# Return Policy

## All sales are final
Each of our products are custom printed upon ordering, in order to keep our costs as low as possible. We have no warehouse or inventory, and therefore cannot accept returns or issue refunds except in cases where there is an issue with the product recieved. If your order is damaged upon delivery, or is not delivered at all, please contact us at [service@makerandstone.com](mailto:service@makerandstone.com), and we will do our absolute best to ensure you recieve exactly what you've ordered.

Once an order is placed, it cannot be edited, or canceled, for the same reason as above. However, if you need to make minor tweaks to your order, such as changing an address, please contact [service@makerandstone.com](mailto:service@makerandstone.com), and we will do our best to help you out. If you find yourself in this situation, please reach out as soon as possible. We are not bound to any agreement regarding these order alterations, but we will do our best on a case-by-case basis to make sure you are satisfied.

Orders placed with Maker & Stone are fulfilled through [Printful](https://theprintful.com), and our return policy is based on theirs. Products can only be returned to the address enclosed in the packaging of your order. This is the address of the Printful HQ, based out of Dearborn California.

It is the customer's responsibility to file any claim with a carrier for a lost shipment if carrier tracking indicates that the package was delivered. Unfortunately, in such case Printful will not make any refunds and will not resend the Product.

We will work with Printful to review replacement/return requests only if:

(a) a product is damaged, or there is a print error

(b) Maker & Stone receives a submitted complaint to [service@makerandstone.com](mailto:service@makerandstone.com) within 30 days from the day the product was delivered to the customer.

## Types of Returns

Wrong Address - If you provide an address that is considered insufficient by the courier, the shipment will be returned to the Printful headquarters (19749 Dearborn St, Chatsworth, CA 91311). You will be liable for reshipment costs once we have confirmed an updated address with you. 

Unclaimed - Shipments that go unclaimed are returned to the Printful HQ facility and you will be liable for the cost of a reshipment to you.

Returned by Customer - It is best to first contact us at [service@makerandstone.com](mailto:service@makeradnstone.com) before returning *any* product. This is because the return address on your invoice is of the Printful HQ in California and they do not offer any refund orders for buyerâ€™s remorse, or for size exchanges as each order is custom made for each customer. Therefore, a new order would need to be placed for an updated size. We are sorry for the inconvenience.
